        <h1>Hi! I'm Michaela</h1>
        <p>
          While I spent the better part of my childhood dreaming about exploring
          far-flung places, I didn't get the chance to travel much till I left
          home for school. All told I spent roughly 4 years travelling abroad in
          stints and only 'settled' down in Utah due to circumstance. Travelling
          took a toll on my wallet so I decided the perfect way to get back on
          my snowboard after so much time in tropical climates would be to get a
          job in Park City.
        </p>
        <p>
          About a week after moving in I met my partner Mitch, a Utah native,
          who works as a snowboard insructor and river rafting guide. Between
          the two of us we make a pretty solid adventure duo -- or rather trio
          after the adoptoion of our redtick coonhound pup Scarlett. Our current
          goal is building out our 2004 Sprinter van into tiny house so we can
          check out all the amazing places we haven't visited yet on wheels.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          Getting into the outdoors and exploring with Mitch and Scarlett. These
          days that involves a combination of camping, hiking, rock climbing,
          yoga, river rafting, and snowboarding. And it usually involves a fair
          amount of photographhy and videography.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a serious obsession languages. I speak Spanish and
          Porguguese, my Swedish is mediocre at best, can write in Elvish, and
          am currently learning Japanese and various programming
          languages/frameworks. Some of my other interests include writing,
          environment/sustainability, polictics, and cooking/eating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just being out in nature at any time is amazing, but I have to say my
          favorite activities that really help me appreciate the outdoors even
          more. Namely, rock climbing, snowboarding, camping, hiking, river
          rafting, and yoga.

            Majored in Film Production at University of Southern California.
            These four years were some of the most rewaring. Though my life took
            a different direction photographhy and videography are still
            something I truly love and I try to incorporate them into my
            travels.

            Obssessed with Lord of the Rings since the age of 10, I ditched
            school for a year to get a job on The Hobbit in New Zealand. They
            approved of my Elvish script, but sadly, production was halted when
            the director fell ill. So I bought a very low-key camper van and
            tripped around New Zealand before making my way back to school via
            Southeast Asia and Europe.

            After graduating I spent a few months in Brazil teaching English.
            From there I hitchiked through Boliva, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia,
            Venezuela, Chile, and Argentina before returning to the US. But I
            liked it so much I came back for round 2 during the 2014 World Cup
            and stayed about a year checking out the Brazilian coast, spending 2
            months on friend's sailboat in Panama, trekking through the Amazon,
            and visting some out of this world locations like Chapada Diamantina
            and Len√ßois Maranhenses.
